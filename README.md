# Project: TicTacToe AI Agents

This project was started in inspiration from taking CSS 382 (Intro to Artificial Intelligence) at the University of Washington Bothell. 

## How it works:

There are three different agents currently implemented as an AI opponent. The first agent is a random agent that looks at all the current possible moves and then chooses one at random without any bias. The second agent is a reflex agent that looks at one step ahead and evaluates each possible state. After calculating all possible moves, it chooses at random any of the equally highest score states. The third agent is a minimax agent implemented with alpha-beta pruning that looks at the entire game and moves according to the win/lose state, maximizing the computers score, while minimizing the players score.
